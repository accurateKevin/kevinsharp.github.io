# Kevin Sharp

Tech writer and video producer focused on developer outreach. Clients include Samsung, Roku and Nokia.

As a blockchain technical writer for a global startup, recently completed a project that used:

* [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to generate an API reference for their Python API allowing servers to access the blockchain.
* [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) to generate an API reference for their iOS SDK for clients.
* Javadoc to generate an API reference for their Android SDK for clients.
* [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) as the static site generator allowing multi-language documentation for a global developer base and the ability to view documentation for current and previous SDK and blockchain releases.
* GitHub pages to publish documentation and allow community input. (Remember to disable Jekyll to allow all API reference directories to be processed by GitHub publishing process.)

# Content examples
* [Blockchain architecture overview](https://kinecosystem.github.io/kin-website-docs/docs/kin-architecture-overview.html)
* [Video code tutorial](https://github.com/accurateKevin/ContentExamples/blob/master/new-ide-debug-sensor.mp4) showing end-to-end process for coding and installing an embedded system application.
